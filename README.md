HirePilot – Automated Job Application & Interview Platform (No-Code)
It is a no-code platform designed to automate the job search process intelligently—streamlining everything from resume parsing to skill-job matching, application submission, and mock interview generation. Built using the no-code tool Lovable, this project simulates a complete, data-driven hiring pipeline without writing a single line of traditional code.

🧠 Problem Statement

Job seekers often face repetitive, time-consuming tasks, such as tailoring resumes, searching job boards, matching skills to job descriptions, and preparing for interviews—all of which are done manually. HirePilot addresses this inefficiency by delivering an end-to-end automated solution, enabling faster, smarter job applications.

💡 Key Features

Resume Parsing & Structuring: Extracts structured data from uploaded resumes using NLP-like logic built in a no-code environment.

Skill-to-Job Matching: Matches candidate skills to job descriptions using rule-based workflows simulating semantic analysis.

Automated Job Applications: Automatically populates application forms based on parsed resume data and job fit criteria.

Mock Interview Generation: Generates tailored mock interview questions based on the job description and matched skills.

No-Code Logic Simulation: Recreates core data science concepts (NLP parsing, logic-based decisioning, and automation) using visual workflows in Lovable.
